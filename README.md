## Features

- **Data Processing:** Scripts and notebooks for handling geomagnetic and geographic datasets.
- **Location Estimation:** Methods for inferring or analyzing locations based on magnetic or geospatial data.
- **Sample Workflows:** Example Python scripts to demonstrate usage and reproducibility.
- **Result Tracking:** Organized output and final result directories for easy validation.
- **Future Enhancements:** Dedicated space for proposed improvements and ongoing research.
